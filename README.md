# CacheCoherencySim
Cache coherency simulator based on bus-based protocols with Snoop Filtering 

A cache coherency simulator with Snoop Filtering simulating a 4-core shared multi-core processor architecture. It works on the basis of well-known bus-based coherency protocols like MSI and MESI with its multiple variations. Snoop Filtering in the form of a History Filter helps the requesting core avoid unnecessary snoops. 

The program in src reads the trace files in trace and the validation runs are given in the val directory.
